# lab2: Continuous Integration

This is a continuous integration server for Java projects that are using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). It can be set up as a webhook for GitHub repositories where it will build and test the program, then both report the result as a commit-status in GitHub and save the result for later access.

## Build and run
The server is built with Java 21 using Gradle. Follow these steps to compile the project: 

1. Set Java version to Java 21.
2. Run `./gradlew build` (or import into gradle-compatible IDE).
