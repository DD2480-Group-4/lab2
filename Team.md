# Team

The team finds itself in the Performing state.

The team has been Seeded as we have agreed
upon a team composition, we have defined
our way of working and the level of
commitment have been made clear.

The team has been Formed as the members
are taking on responsibility regarding 
work aligning with their established
competences. The team is also communicating
well and the roles of the members are
defined and understood by all team members.

The team is Collaborating as all team 
members are working together towards
completing the team mission. The team is
working individually on different parts
of the project and is able to do so
because there is a level of trust within
the group that all members will perform
well. This trust is rooted in the open
communication where the team members
are honest about the work they do and 
when running into problems.

The team is Performing as commitments are
consistently met and the team is able to
identify and handle problems well within
the team. Working around problems and the
process of identifying and eliminating 
wasted work means that the team also 
adapts to new contexts. Thanks to covering
tests and clear problem definitions also
means that the team needs minimal
backtracking and reworking.

As the team is still actively working,
the team is not in the Adjourned state yet.
